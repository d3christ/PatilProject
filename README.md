Hey Reddit,

Doing a group project for my Data Science class. We have cleaned all the data to the best of our abilities but my group and I lack the statistical knowledge to do anything worthy of showing to DJ Patil, former Cheif Data Scientist under the Obama Admin. If we do something interesting we can compete with other groups to show him our project but we've hit a wall. 

Any recommendations/advice would be greatly apprieciated!
